# docker-mongo-flask
Learning how to build scalable fulls stack webservice solution... from someone else... using my own two hands.

## Note

Code for the tutorial from the website: https://medium.com/@riken.mehta/full-stack-tutorial-flask-react-docker-420da3543c91

does not work out of the box.  Rather than debug someone else's code I'm going to build this from scratch and use the abobve tutorial as a guide.  There are some odd idiosyncrasies with the code.
